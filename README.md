# Trip planner

Trip planner is a platform to browse and purchase travelling experiences. The dashboard presentes three levels of filering: by country, by city and by date.
Each of the filter is only enabled when the previous ones have been filled in. Once all filters have been configured, the available trips options will be shown.
